        A BAG full of <em>pan de sal</em> cut into pieces mixed with a cup of condensed milk, three spoonfuls of Ovaltine powder, a piece of egg and a teaspoon of vanilla extract, small balls of dough formed and baked for 5-7 minutes in a preheated oven toaster-that was what baking was for me when I was nine years old, a baker in the making.

        It would be unfair to ahve baking "all boxed up." True, it is a complete science, with the need to be precise with measurements and timing, but it is also an art-it can be interpreted in a number of ways, in different styles. Appreciating baking requires understanding not only the process by which something is made but also the role of each ingredients in making the perfectly baked goodie.

        The secret to a successful baking escapade is using the right tools and ingredients, and storing them properly, too. Sometimes, the flour is just so much mightier than the sword.
